This is a very special project that we (Mafu Games) did as freelancers for Exit Games. This project is a technology demonstration of Exit Game's powerful tool called Quantum, a revolutionary technology that has come to make the development of online games much better.
Here, we created a fast paced spellcasting game as a showcase on how Quantum can create amazing multiplayer experiences.
